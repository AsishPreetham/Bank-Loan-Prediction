# Bank-Loan-Prediction
A Stacked model For Approving Bank Loan


Machine learning is playing a prominent role in current era. In this modernized 
world almost all the applications are manipulated and controlled by machine 
learning algorithms. By the use of historical data there are possibilities to 
predict the future. Even though a number of researchers are working on 
various machine learning, the performance and exactness of the algorithms 
still remains as a challenge. This work focuses on the performance analysis of 
various classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Gaussian Na√Øve 
Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier in terms of 
confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure etc., and performance 
enhancement of those algorithms using stacking to predict the bank loan 
approval status so we can overcome the need to depend on a single machine 
learning model instead we can combine multiple models so to obtain a stacked 
model which provides better predictions as compared to each individual model

# What is STACKING?

Stacking is an ensemble machine learning algorithm. It uses a meta-learning 
algorithm to learn how best combine the predictions from two or more base 
machine learning algorithms. The benefit of stacking is that it harnesses the 
capabilities of a range of well performing models on a classification or 
regression task and make predictions that have better performance than any 
single model in the ensemble. 
Hence by using stacking we will be able to create a new classifier that 
hopefully will give better accuracy compared to all other base models.
